# 🧪 MongoDB Labs

This repository is an **experimentation and learning space** for testing MongoDB concepts, features, and use cases.

## 🎯 Purpose

**mongodb-labs** serves as a laboratory for:

- **Testing new MongoDB features** before production implementation
- **Experimenting with different patterns** for data modeling
- **Learning advanced concepts** through practical projects
- **Creating proofs of concept (PoCs)** for specific functionalities
- **Documenting findings** and best practices

## 📁 Structure

Each directory in this repository contains an independent project or experiment focused on exploring specific MongoDB concepts and features.

## 🚀 How to Use
